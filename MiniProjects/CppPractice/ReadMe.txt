Basics of C++

Syntax and Basic Constructs: Learn about basic syntax, data types, operators, and how to write simple programs in C++.
Control Structures: Understand conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
Functions: How to define and use functions, including parameter passing and returning values.

2. Advanced Data Handling

Arrays and Strings: Understand static arrays, strings, and the operations you can perform on them.
Pointers: Crucial in C++, pointers allow you to manipulate memory directly.
Dynamic Memory Management: Learn how to dynamically allocate memory using new and delete.

3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and Objects: Learn how to define classes and create objects.
Encapsulation: Understand the importance of keeping data safe within an object.
Inheritance: Learn about extending classes and how inheritance promotes code reuse.
Polymorphism: Focus on both compile-time (overloading) and run-time (overriding) polymorphism.

4. Advanced Features

Templates: Learn about generic programming with function and class templates.
Exception Handling: Understand how to manage errors and exceptions in a robust manner.
Standard Template Library (STL): Get to know various data structures and algorithms, such as vectors, lists, maps, stacks, queues, and algorithm functions for sorting, searching, etc.

5. Effective C++ and Best Practices

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): Understand how to manage resources (like memory, file handles, etc.) safely and efficiently.
Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr): Use smart pointers to manage resources automatically.
Move Semantics and Rvalue References: Learn about modern C++ features introduced in C++11 and later.
Concurrency: Basic multithreading, mutexes, and locks.

6. Build Tools and Environments

Compilers: Familiarize yourself with GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
Build Systems: Learn to use Makefiles, CMake, or other build systems to compile and link your C++ projects.
Debugging and Profiling Tools: Get accustomed to tools like GDB for debugging and Valgrind for memory leak detection.
